The Yale Center for British Art (YCBA) in downtown New Haven houses the largest collection of British Art outside the United Kingdom. Its 4-stories are filled with collections and exhibitions meant to amaze and spur conversation. Currently, visitors navigating the YCBA are invited to use markers located throughout the building and static floor plans on the YCBA website; however, the floor plans are non-interactive and tedious to alter as exhibitions change. For this project, we created an interactive map of the YCBA galleries displaying artworks currently in each bay. We built the website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript and queried from the YCBA’s Linked Open Data collection using SPARQL. By querying from the collection, the map will update itself to reflect the changing of exhibitions and the movement of artwork. 

My goal was to make a product that would fit into the style of the YCBA website and the style of other museums’ interactive maps. To make the project manageable, I partitioned the project into the following components:  background research (I researched existing museum websites to see how they represent the physical layout of their museum and its contents. In particular, I looked at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City), Open Linked Data and SPARQL (Compared to Google Big Query, Open Linked Data is much more suitable for the kind of data stored and queried for art historians. I explored the intricacies of Open Linked Data and SPARQL in my quest to develop my query), HTML/CSS and Javascript (Since I was not familiar with these languages, I had to learn about them a great deal before I was able to start programming), and Google Maps (I integrated a Google Maps component into my project in order to become more familiar with Google’s API).
